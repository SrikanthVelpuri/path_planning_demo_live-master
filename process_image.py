#used in games like Warcraft III. 
#searching among all possible paths to the solution (goal) for the one that incurs the smallest 
#cost (least distance travelled, shortest time, etc.), and among these paths it first considers 
#the ones that appear to lead most quickly to the solution. 
#we generate our possibilities and pick the one with the least projected cost. 
#Once a possibility is generated and its cost is calculated, 
#it stays in the list of possibilities until all the better nodes have been searched before it
